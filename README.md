## Background
SpicyFood is a fictional FoodTech Company. 

The company‚Äôs management wanted to gain deeper insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and overall value contribution. Specifically, they were interested in:

- Identifying their most valuable customers.
- Understanding customer demographics such as age and gender.
- Segmenting customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- Finding opportunities to retain at-risk customers and convert occasional buyers into loyal ones.

To address this, SpicyFood engaged in a Customer Segmentation project using the RFM Analysis model. By leveraging Tableau, the project translates raw transactional data into an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for decision-making.

- **(Frequency) F‚Ää‚Äî**‚ÄäHow often does a customer make a transaction?
- **(Monetary) M‚Ää‚Äî**‚ÄäHow much money does a customer spend on a purchase?
